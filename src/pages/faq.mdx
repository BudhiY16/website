Tattle works to:

- Reduce the lifecycle of misinformation on WhatsApp and other chat apps.
- Enable open and transparent research on misinformation on social media, especially in private and encrypted networks.

We work towards these goals, prioritizing:

- Openness so that anyone can use, change and share the tools made at Tattle for their unique context
- Accessibility because India is a land of diverse experiences and all should be represented in the online information ecosystem.
- Sustainability because there is a lot of work to do but also a long way to go!
- Humility because there are many stalwarts to learn from.
- Curiosity because without a spirit of exploration one can't be effective in a rapidly changing problem space.

## How Does Tattle Sustain Itself?

Tattle is an open source project whose primary goal is to create common resources for research and response to misinformation. A lot of our work is sustained through grants. Through 2019 - 2020 a 100K USD grant from the [AI Ethics Initiative](https://aiethicsinitiative.org/news/2019/3/12/announcing-the-winners-of-the-ai-and-the-news-open-challenge) supported our work.
We also take up paid contracts for supporting researchers and organizations for analyzing data or customizing the open source tools for their applications. Our goal is to cover 60% of the project operating costs through paid contracts. While we are don't pursue work at Tattle with the goal of making a profit, a steady revenue stream supports long term sustainability of the project. The infrastructure costs increase with volume of archived data and sophistication of search and analysis features. A steady revenue stream will ensure that we can continually maintain the resources built.
Tattle is registered as a private limited company in India. The CIN is: U72900HR2019PTC079285. Past financials can be found on our [Annual Reports](/report/2019-report) page.
